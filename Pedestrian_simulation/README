## File Descriptions

### 1. SUMO Configuration (`ped_sim.sumocfg`)
Basic configuration file that defines:
- Input files (network and routes)
- Simulation duration (1000 steps)
- Step length (0.3 seconds)
- Pedestrian model type (nonInteracting)
- GUI settings for visualization

### 2. Network Definition (`ped_net.net.xml`)
Defines a simple walkway with:
- Single straight pathway (100m length)
- Pedestrian-specific lane (2m width)
- Two endpoints (West and East)
- Walking speed limit (1.4 m/s)

### 3. Routes Configuration (`ped_routes.rou.xml`)
Defines:
- Pedestrian type with parameters:
  - Width: 0.7m
  - Length: 0.35m
  - Min gap: 0.25m
  - Max speed: 1.4 m/s
- Single test pedestrian
- Continuous flow (one pedestrian every 2 seconds)

### 4. Simulation Control (`ped_control.py`)
Python script that:
- Initializes the SUMO-GUI simulation
- Monitors pedestrian movements
- Collects statistics about:
  - Number of pedestrians
  - Pedestrian positions
  - Edge occupancy

## Running the Simulation

1. Set the SUMO_HOME environment variable:
```bash
export SUMO_HOME="/path/to/sumo"
```

2. Run the simulation:
```bash
python ped_control.py
```

The script outputs statistics every 50 simulation steps, including:
- Current simulation step
- Total number of pedestrians
- Positions of up to 5 pedestrians
- Current edge IDs for pedestrians

## Understanding the Output

The simulation provides the following metrics:
- **Pedestrian Count**: Total number of pedestrians in simulation
- **Positions**: (x,y) coordinates of pedestrians
- **Edge IDs**: Current edge where each pedestrian is located
- **Simulation Step**: Current step in the simulation

## Pedestrian Movement

Pedestrians move along the walkway with:
- Constant flow rate (one new pedestrian every 2 seconds)
- Regular walking speed (1.4 m/s)
- Fixed pathway from West to East
- No interactions between pedestrians (simple model)

## Notes

- Simulation runs for 1000 steps by default
- Uses yellow coloring for pedestrian visualization
- Simple non-interacting pedestrian model
- GUI visualization enabled for observation
- Statistics printed every 50 steps
